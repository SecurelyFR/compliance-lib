## Security

This project is maintained by [Securely](https://securely.id) with the goal of providing a secure and reliable library of smart contract components for the ecosystem. We address security through risk management in various areas such as engineering and open source best practices, scoping and API design, multi-layered review processes, and incident response preparedness.

You are invited to report security vulnerabilities freely at contact@securely.id. Any good-faith alert will be treated with kindness.

Smart contracts are a nascent technology and carry a high level of technical risk and uncertainty. Although Securely cares very much about security, using Securely Contracts is not a substitute for a security audit.
